Make sure that this exact part is configured with exact location of your webdriver/webdrivers.
The location should link to either geckodriver.exe or chromedriver.exe on Windows.
On MacOS/Linux Systems it should link to chromedriver/geckodriver.

Make sure that DRIVER_PATH is linking to the according Webdriver that you specify below. Example:
    DRIVER_PATH = "C:/bin/geckodriver.exe"
